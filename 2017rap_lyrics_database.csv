Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (Yeh, yeh)

In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say, ""You're the worst, you're the worst""
I cannot die because this my universe

I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes

It's Cardi, ayy
Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 1]
Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

[Verse 2]
If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrive in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

[Chorus]
Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move

I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA

I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA

Money and power, the mecca of marriages

Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, 'member when you had them green things mailed
With vacuum seals tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan though, ayy, Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Ayy, JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?

Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya

Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly

You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga

Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge

What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio

I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga

Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on

Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona, I was round that corner
Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down do Sawyer
When we slide, you won't see morning
Another story of a young black man
Tryna make it up out that jam, god damn
Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans
If you hatin' don't shake my hand
Take it easy, homie

Of the 22 bus stop way back when
With the 22, 5 shot eyes on scan

Women problems every morning like the Maury show
Swimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread
From the sharks make me wanna put the hammer to my head
At the park politickin' with the kids
Tryna get em on a straight path, got the lames mad
Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation conversations what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss
Wanna be the boss then you gotta pay the cost

With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though

Only thing that sold out is the seats though

If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well

Bumping Silkk Da Shocker Charge It 2 Da Game
Paint dripping like I’m whipping marmalade (whoa)
Look at the way that I’m shining
I don’t be checking the mileage
She said how much is that Rolie?
I said don’t worry I’m timeless
Watching Toy Story 3, that’s a great fucking movie
City of Jimi, Kurt, Quincy

Neighbors hate it when I speed out

I be on my business, and you be on Tinder
And if I was single, I’d be right there with ya
But I’m committed, keep my dick in my britches
The women are moving their bodies
Sunset through numerous palm trees
Followed by the paparazzi
But they don’t get into our party
Tell the bell hop that I’m sorry
We 40 deep in the lobby
Travel the world with a posse
But soon I’ll be home
So call up my momma and tell her to pick up the phone
Cause I need that homemade lasagna that’s fresh out the stove
Grabbing the keys and I’m fresh out the door
King of my city whose next on the throne

Push the coup down the highway like a go kart
All my niggas keep that toaster with them like a Pop Tart
Make her moan and she sound just like Mozart

I think they mad because I broke into the game with a crowbar
Top the charts, Hip Hop ain’t the same we the new stars

Ring pops, let the rain drop on the wrist watch
Fuck the cops, and fuck Donald Trump, bitch it’s Macklemore and Lil Boat

Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
Back when I was broke, they was cool with it

That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it

Pull up Ghost Ghost, Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it, I go through it, don't show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag

Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you

37,4095,540610,34EP7KEpOjXcM2TCat1ISk,2yZp0a4buLcNHCw4NAjwqh,Buddha Monk,"Chapter 3In the LabIn the span of two and a half years, Dirty went from homeless to
hood superhero, and I was there to see it all happen. He took me
to see RZA at his place in the Stapleton Projects in Staten Island,
and to Firehouse Studios in Manhattan, where he was working on Wu-Tang Clan’s full-length debut, Enter the Wu-Tang
(36 Chambers). A lot of hip-hop producers refer to the studio as the lab, and watching RZA work I came to see why that was. The nigga was like a mad scientist, like Dr. Frankenstein bringing a new song to life by stitching together pieces of musical history. On “Wu-Tang Clan Ain’t Nuthin ta Fuck Wit,” RZA sampled drums from the Lafayette Afro Rock Band and Joe Tex, and a couple seconds of a vocal from the theme from the old television cartoon  Underdog.  You wouldn’t even recognize that the sample came from the  Underdog  theme, because RZA slowed it down, cut it apart, and reassembled it into the sound you hear on the album.

RZA was bringing together the sounds and the styles that had
influenced him growing up. Not only the records he listened to, but the cartoons he watched on TV and the movies he watched with his cousins. RZA didn’t stop with digging through crates of old funk and soul records to find drumbeats and horns—he sampled dialogue and sound effects from the old kung-fu movies he and Dirty and GZA used to watch at the Forty-second Street theaters in Manhattan. The album is driven by sounds of karate chops and of swords being unsheathed and slicing through the air and clanging against each other. The first track, “Bring da Ruckus,” opens with two swordsmen talking:

“Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?”

“En garde. I’ll let you try my Wu-Tang style.”

Those samples gave the album a feel that said Wu-Tang Clan was ready for battle. You other rappers think you can test their skills, then bring it on.

Watching RZA in the studio I learned how to produce a record. Up
to that point I was known for my DJing and singing, but working with RZA and Dirty in the studio, I became a hip-hop producer. I was making beats with the samplers and drum machines, mixing tracks at the boards. I found myself putting in so much time on Dirty’s album that I neglected my own DJing and singing, but that apprenticeship in the studio was what helped shape me into a rap artist. First of all, I learned work ethic—I watched RZA work on the Wu-Tang Clan’s album  Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)  at the same time he was working on songs for solo albums by Dirty, GZA, and Method Man.

Then I learned production techniques. I would watch RZA on the mixing board and realize that he would never put just two or three samples on a song. He would have so many tracks full of instruments that it was amazing. Most producers would be thinking they’re only gonna have the drums—the kicks, the snare, the high hat—and two or three melodies. Not RZA. He would have like twenty-five melodies on one track. On a lot of songs they did he would reuse the same beat but change the melodies. He’s incredible for doing that. I’m telling you, I was so amazed by that. Instead of thinking of just getting one track done at a time, he would have five or six tracks working at once, off of one beat. He would take the same drums and change the samples and make six songs out of it.


RZA’s production sounded like nothing people had ever heard—it was gritty and sparse but at the same time it was layered like a symphony. On “Shame on a Nigga” he sampled jazz piano from Thelonious Monk and overlaid it with funk horns from Syl Johnson. People criticize hip-hop for sampling because they think producers just steal an old record and rap over it—they don’t understand tha the piano may come from an old jazz record, the horns from a funk record, and it takes skill to combine those sounds into a new symphony. Plus, RZA played a lot of the piano himself. One of his signature sounds was a spooky piano clink he achieved by playing the notes on an actual piano-zither, then sampling them and looping them to repeat throughout the song. Running his piano through the sampler made it sometimes play back out of tune because the sampler’s technology had not yet been perfected. But RZA took that shortcoming in the equipment and made the out-of- tune piano part of his sound. He brought string instruments into hip-hop and he offset them with hard drumbeats that weren’t made for the dance floor or the radio because RZA wanted his music to sound aggressive to inspire his rappers to sound aggressive.

In 1992, the biggest hip-hop album in the U.S. was Dr. Dre’s The Chronic, which was built around Dre’s G-Funk sound, characterized by music that is slow, groovy, and melodic. Dre was sampling funk records while RZA was sampling jazz. I loved Dre’s album, but it had California written all over it. Dre was making music for the people where he came from, L.A. The Chronic was music that they could drive around playing in their low-riders or have a cookout to—just the scenes you see in Dre’s video for “Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang.” But Wu-Tang was from New York, and RZA wanted to bring the sound back to New York with something up-tempo but gritty, with hard beats underneath jazz piano.

RZA’s production was perfect for Dirty, but when Dirty would first hear a beat he had an ear for what was missing. One night I’d stayed at the studio longer than Dirty had, watching RZA work on a beat he wanted Dirty to rhyme over. Dirty called back a few hours later and said, “Yo, let me hear it.” And over the phone the nigga could hear something that wasn’t supposed to be in there and be like, “Yo, you hear that?”

“What are you talking about? I don’t hear anything.”

“Pull those levels down, one at a time. There. That’s what I’m talking about.”

“How the fuck you hear that through the phone?”

He said, “Pay attention, Buddha. Wake up. Open your ears.” And that’s how I got to be the perfectionist I am today with my music. Dirty said, “I want you to put everything you got into every track you make. I want every track to be the best one you ever did. RZA’s the best, but I want you to strive to be better than RZA.”

RZA and the Wu-Tang Clan changed the way hip-hop is made. From the way producers put tracks together, to the way MCs rhyme, all the way down to the way you sign a contract with a record label. Wu-Tang was a group of nine MCs who could each stand powerfully on their own, but when they come together to form Wu-Tang, watch out. Like that old cartoon, Voltron, where the robot lions come together to form one super-robot? That was how Wu-Tang worked.

When Wu-Tang signed to Loud Records/RCA in 1992, they negotiated an unprecedented deal—Wu-Tang Clan, as a group, would record for Loud, but the nine members were free to sign deals as solo artists with any record label they chose. Before Wu-Tang, when you signed to a label they owned you. If you wanted to go do a guest verse on somebody else’s song you had to run it past your label first, and recording an album for another label was out of the question. RZA and GZA had both been signed to solo deals before Wu-Tang, so they’d seen the problems that come with signing a contract without negotiating to get what you want. What Wu-Tang did was shift the power from the record label to the group. They were like a hip-hop labor union. They had strength in numbers.

But to make this kind of power move in the industry, what Wu-Tang had to do was build a buzz around their name. They paid their dues playing mad shows all over New York and selling records out of the trunks of their cars. That “Protect Ya Neck” single they self released
caught the attention of the major labels. GZA’s verse on that song even took a shot at the labels, almost daring the labels to sign them, saying Wu-Tang was too good for them: “The Wu is too slammin’ for these Cold Killin’ labels / Some ain’t had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel.” But off that first single, when DJs started to play it, what I remember hearing most was them cutting Dirty’s voice—“First things first, man, you fuckin’ with the worst”—and playing his verse again and again.

Everybody in Wu-Tang loved Dirty. Everybody couldn’t wait for Dirty to come through the door, because not only was Dirty talented, he was funny. He knew how to make niggas laugh when he came to the studio. He would get the work done, but he also knew how to keep you laughing. Everybody wanted to rap with Dirty, and Dirty wanted to rap with everybody. The fans loved him too—Dirty entranced the women, but he also was grimy, so he hooked the niggas too. The girls loved his swagger and what he was saying, but Dirty could say some dumb shit in the middle of a verse and niggas would say, “Yo, this nigga just went to the left on this song but he came back and it’s still a killer!” Method Man even said it in an interview. They asked him what entertainers he looked up to and he said, “Yo, the greatest entertainer to me is Dirty.”

Inspectah Deck agreed with Meth: “I remember the first time I met Ol’ Dirty. RZA brought him over to his crib, and as soon as Dirty got there, he was like, ‘Turn that beat on!’ He was straight off the street with a forty in his hand, and he got on the mic and kicked some crazy shit. ODB was the same dude off the mic as he was on the mic. He never held anything back. He’d be in the mall, just performing, singing the theme to The Love Boat.” Dirty mixed rapping with singing, but he did it in a way that was funny too. On “Shimmy Shimmy Ya” he sampled Richard Pryor’s comedy album That Nigger’s Crazy. Pryor had a joke about how the girls would turn him down—he mocks a girl’s voice saying, “I ain’t gonna fuck you, you can’t even sing,” then he tells the audience, “You have to sang or somethin’ to get some pussy.” That’s how Dirty ended his song—“Shimmy Shimmy Ya” goes from Dirty crooning over RZA’s piano tinkling, “Ooooh, baby, I like it raw. Ooooh, baby, I like it raaaaaw,” to “I ain’t gonna fuck you, you can’t even sing.”

Loud gave Wu-Tang Clan a $200,000 advance for their first album, which sounds like a lot of money until you divide it nine ways and take into account that RZA got a bigger cut than anyone else because he produced the entire album. Dirty walked away from the table with less than $20,000 in his pocket. Still, he was happy. He was making money from music, and this was only stage one of the plan. He knew his solo deal was in the works, and he trusted that RZA knew the business. Dirty was watching the way RZA handled his business and telling me, “We have to work hard the way RZA does. We got to get our own thing together, our own team, the way RZA did with Wu-Tang.”

“What you mean?”

“All the niggas from the block. You’re doing the producing. Merdoc raps. Raison raps, 12 O’Clock raps. Shorty Shitstain raps. That’s our crew. Put us all together and that’s the Brooklyn Zoo.”

“That’s what we should call the crew? The Brooklyn Zoo?”

“That’s what Raison’s been calling us. Yo, but we’ll spell it with a U to make our Wu-Tang connection clear—you got the Wu, then you got the Zu. We’ll put y’all on my album and springboard it from there. When the Ol’ Dirty Bastard album comes out it’ll let people know about the Brooklyn Zu before we start releasing Brooklyn Zu albums.”

From the beginning, Dirty wanted to make our crew, the Brooklyn Zu, his own branch of the Wu-Tang Clan, just like Ghostface Killah had his Theodore Unit and Raekwon had his American Cream Team and Ice Water Inc. It’s a rap dream to make it and bring your boys and your cousins and your cousins’ boys with you. When a rapper hits it big he tends to start his own group or even his own label so that he can sign his people to record deals. Eminem has Shady Records, 50 Cent has G-Unit Records, and when RZA founded Wu-Tang Records the first acts he signed were Killarmy—which was RZA’s brother 9th Prince’s group—and Sunz of Man, which was his cousin Sixty Second Assassin’s group.

Dirty had the Brooklyn Zu, which was me and four of Dirty’s cousins: Merdoc, 12 O’Clock, Raison the Zu Keeper, and Shorty Shitstain. Then under the Brooklyn Zu umbrella we recruited Da Manchuz and the Zu Ninjaz, who were dudes we met on the road playing shows. Dirty loved the Zu Ninjaz: K-Blunt, Irie the Five-Foot Hyper Sniper, Obe, Hook Ninja, and Popa Chief. We first met them when Dirty and I started touring off his album and we did a show in Delaware at Cheney University. Popa Chief opened for us—he had a solo deal at the time. We went in, we performed, then we stood outside drinking beers with Popa Chief, Irie, and K-Blunt. Dirty liked them and he liked the way they rapped, so he said, “Y’all come to the hotel with us.”

We hung out with them for two days, but Dirty had to go back to New York, so he told me, “Listen, I’m gonna give you like three or four stacks in your pocket. I want you to hang out here a few days. All them niggas rap, and they’re nice on the mic. I want you to stay close to them. They’ll be another chapter of the Brooklyn Zu. They’re the Zu Ninjaz now.” At the time they was the Five-Foot Ninjaz. Adding the Zu would tell people they were now part of Brooklyn Zu.

Dirty headed back to New York, and me and Blunt took a ride in the Suburban. I told him about Dirty’s plan to bring him into the Brooklyn Zu family. “Yo, man,” I said. “I have some shit to tell you. I see how everybody pay attention and the way you do things. I need you to get all of them together and let them know you the general and it’s a life commitment, we gonna keep pushing no matter what.” I told Blunt, “I got Da Manchuz. I want you to head up the Zu Ninjaz. They gotta follow you, Blunt, cause I can’t tell everybody what to do. I need a general to handle that branch of the tree.”

Even before Wu-Tang Clan’s first album came out, me and Dirty were playing solo shows for Ol’ Dirty Bastard and the Brooklyn Zu and making moves to establish our own team. That was all part of the plan. At the same time Wu-Tang Clan was recording its debut album, Dirty was in the studio with RZA working on solo tracks like “Cuttin’ Headz.” Method Man was working on solo tracks. GZA was working on tracks for his solo album. Everybody was watching RZA to learn how the production was done. RZA was the one overseeing the whole operation, but he was working on albums for Wu-Tang Clan, Method Man, GZA, Raekwon, himself, and Dirty, so some days he’d give Dirty a beat to rhyme over, and Dirty and I would record the vocals and mix the track and then play it back for RZA when he came back.

I started to understand Dirty’s sound and the style he was looking for. I’d watched the way RZA used different compression settings for each of the Wu-Tang members’ voices, and I’d developed a good ear for what worked for Dirty. Dirty would come in and lay some vocals, then I’d work on the mixing board to give his voice the character it needed and the track the effects it needed. The turning point for me, when I really started to feel like I knew what I was doing, was when RZA dropped off a new beat he wasn’t completely happy with and said, “Something’s missing in this one, Dirty, you know what I mean?” He played it for us and he and Dirty sat back trying to figure out what it still needed. Dirty turned to me and asked, “What you think, Buddha?” I gave them my opinion and they both nodded their heads and Dirty said, “Yo, son. That’s my man. He’s gonna be in the studio with me from now on. He knows what he’s talking about. He knows what he’s doin’. We’re not recording without Buddha.”

Dirty took me with him to the shows, too. I knew how to keep the party moving as a DJ, and I knew how to rock a show. Wu-Tang was playing concerts around New York. I’d help Dirty load up his Plymouth Sundance with cases of Olde English 800 and we’d hit the road. There were no hard drugs back then. Dirty loved to drink Olde English and he’d mess with weed when it was around—it was usually around—but he never liked to smoke too much because it made him paranoid. Wu-Tang Clan was selling tickets on the strength of the “Protect Ya Neck” single and word of mouth that they knew how to play a live show. Wu-Tang shows were known to be crazy. They were known to devolve into fights and riots because the Wu played the kind of music that made you want to stomp your feet and beat somebody’s ass. I mean, shit, Wu-Tang had a song called “Bring da Ruckus.” And the Brooklyn Zu, we was already labeled untamed niggas. What’s the zoo? The zoo is a bunch of wild-ass animal niggas. You can’t take your eye off them or they’re gonna escape and run to center cage. The Clan would be ready to do the shows and when shit would jump off they were fightin’ niggas with their fists, but the Zu would be the ones who would show up and people would say, “Oh, here come the flying chairs. Here come the pool sticks. Here come the broken windows.” So when people left the show they were like, “That was the greatest show I ever saw. We got to see them perform and see people get they ass busted.”

Dirty loved to perform, and he loved to see shit get wild. You’ve seen rock bands smashing guitars—Dirtywas the hip-hop version of that. Even when he wasn’t listed to perform he did it. When he was in the crowd at a show, he would jump onstage and snatch the mic. He’d snatch the mic from anyone. He didn’t care. He did it to the Roots. He did it to the Lost Boyz. He did it to the legendary Doug E. Fresh. Dirty said it best himself: “I don’t like to see wack-ass niggas doin’ a show. If they not doin’ it right, I’m gonna show ’em how it’s done. I apologize for being like that, but that’s me. It’s something I’m trying to control.” His mama didn’t like it at all. “Rusty,” she’d scold him, “that’s not nice.”

The Wu-Tang Clan made eight hundred dollars to play a show that’s eight hundred split nine ways. They pulled up to the venue in a beat-up van. After the shows me and Dirty used to steal the van from the rest of the group. Dirty would want to go home but they’d still want to keep going with the after-party. So Dirty would take the Wu-Tang van. Me, him, and the Brooklyn Zu would get on the highway and head back to Brooklyn. RZA and all them would be calling us: “Yo, bring the van back!” and Dirty would just keep driving, yelling into the phone, “Yo, I told y’all niggas I wanted to go home. Y’all thought I was joking. Fuck you. This is my van too. I paid for this shit too.”

RZA says Dirty pulled a gun at one of those early Wu-Tang shows, at the Culture Club in Brooklyn. The fans had started to riot before the show even started—breaking windows and tearing apart the venue—so Dirty pulled a gun and started shooting at the ceiling. Now that’s crowd control. This was all part of Wu-Tang’s appeal. They were gritty. They were rough around the edges when there was too much cleaned-up pop rap on the radio. Hip-hop had gone through the pop rap explosion with MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice dancing in them shiny-ass pants, then Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg blew up on the West Coast. Not to take nothin’ away from Dre and Snoop, but Dre’s production was clean and laid-back in every way RZA’s was muddy and aggressive. You can hear it in the production on Enter the Wu-Tang. RZA wanted to keep the sound dark and muffled and dirty. He wanted to capture the feel of the hood in that sound, establish an atmosphere that felt like the places Wu-Tang came from. RZA and Ghostface were living in the Stapleton projects out in Staten Island. Method Man, Deck, and Raekwon were in Park Hill, otherwise known as Killa Hill. And you know about Dirty’s block—we had family out there on Putnam and Franklin, but it was still a tough place to come from.

RZA was involved in a shooting in Steubenville, Ohio, not long before that album came out—he was facing eight years for attempted murder. Steubenville’s a suburb of Pittsburgh. RZA and Dirty had family there, so they both spent some time there as kids. By 1992, RZA and Ghostface Killah had moved out there full time. RZA was dealing drugs, and in the course of the trouble that brought them from the Steubenville natives, Ghost got shot, their Steubenville friend Wise got murdered, and RZA got charged with attempted murder after a shootout with a rival crew. RZA’s girlfriend was pregnant with his first child, and he was sitting in jail. He was in there thirty days awaiting his trial, and when he beat the case he rededicated himself to the Five Percent lessons and to his plan to make Wu-Tang Clan one of the biggest hip-hop groups of all time.

There were so many court cases going on with Wu-Tang while they were making that first album that they spent about as much time in court as they spent in the studio. Masta Killa and U-God were in jail during most of the time spent recording that first album. That’s why you barely hear them on there. Masta Killa has one verse on “Da Mystery of Chessboxin’” and U-God has the first verse on that one and four lines on “Protect Ya Neck.” Around the time of their first album, Masta Killa was best known as the dude who didn’t like the illustrations that got published with a Wu-Tang interview in Rap Pages, so when he saw the reporter sitting in his car in a parking lot, he walked over and punched him in the face. In ’92, Dirty was involved in a bar fight in New York and ended up getting charged with assault. He paid a $5,000 fine and was sentenced to five years’ probation.

Almost all of the Wu’s nine members had arrest records. I found my own trouble too. I went with Dirty and our man Pop for a Wu-Tang show out in Staten Island. Dirty had bought a little four-door with his advance for Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and we were on our way to the show. Dirty said, “Yo, I wanna do something different for this show. I got to make sure my outfit looks better than anybody else’s.”

“Well, what you want to do?”

Dirty pulled the car over and ran into a little corner bodega. Me and Pop was like, What is this nigga doing? Dirty came out with a forty of Olde E and a pair of stockings and hopped back in the car tearing open the packaging.

“You gonna put on some pantyhose, nigga? Ain’t no girls out here.”

He stretched the stockings over his face and tied up the legs on top of his head. Wu-Tang loved wearing those stocking masks. Inspectah Deck said, “There was a mystique about the group . . . I mean, we were wearing stocking caps on the [album] cover! We didn’t care if people saw our faces. It wasn’t a fashion show. Nobody knew us, but they knew of us. They knew the name. And that was powerful.” I don’t know why Dirty didn’t wait till he got to the show to put the stocking cap on. We were on the main street by the projects and the cops drove by as soon as he stretched it over his head. They thought we was gonna rob the store. They turned on the siren and drove back around to us, hopped out with their guns pulled and screaming, “Get out of the car! Get down on the ground!”

I looked at Dirty. “I ain’t getting on no fucking ground, man.”

“I ain’t getting down on no fucking ground either.”

We held our hands out the window and Dirty yelled to the cops, “You know who we is, man?”

First they grabbed Pop out of the backseat. They threw him on the hood of the car and started searching him. Then they put guns in Dirty’s face, threw him over the car. Then me. They didn’t find nothing on any of us, but when they searched the car they found a gun.

I’m gonna tell the truth—it was Dirty’s gun. It wasn’t to hurt nobody. It was to keep us protected, because even though Dirty was getting paid a little more than a hundred dollars to play this show, niggas in the hood see him come off stage and they know he has money in his pocket. But before Dirty could speak my man Pop took the weight. “Whose gun is this?”

“Mine.”

He got three years of house arrest with an ankle bracelet and three years’ probation. Pop had actually never been in trouble, didn’t have no record. So he took the weight for the gun. If Dirty would have took the gun he could have wound up doing twenty years. He had a felony on his record from that bar fight. It reminds me of the story I heard the Notorious B.I.G. tell in interviews: it was his gun but his boy took the weight because Biggie had more of an opportunity to make something of himself. It was the same situation with Pop and Dirty. “Yo, Dirty, when I get out and you’re famous, don’t forget about me.”

They locked us up.

I was already on probation, and here I was caught in a car with a gun, so automatically I was staying without bail.

Dirty had a cousin who worked in the jail, so the police was asking Dirty where he wanted to go: general population or PC—protective custody. See, people in there knew who he was. He heard niggas calling his name.

“That’s that nigga Dirty Bastard.”

“Wu-Tang, nigga.”

“Yeah, nigga, you in here now. All that rap shit, we gonna get some of this money from you now.”

Dirty was screaming back: “Try me, motherfuckers. I really wish you motherfuckers would try me.”

Then we’re hearing even more taunts and threats and he sees it’s going to be too many niggas against just one of him. “Yo, I want to  talk to my cousin. I want to go to PC.”

“Nah, fuck that, Dirty,” I said. “I ain’t going to no protective custody. I’m going to the population.”

“I want PC.”

“Fuck PC. I don’t play that shit. Come with me, Dirty. I know everybody from the hood in there anyway. I know mad people.”

I think Dirty knew that if he went to population with me he wouldn’t come back out. They’d either kill him or he’d have to hurt somebody so bad to stay safe that he’d never see the light of day again. Everything would have been ruined. Wu-Tang, his own career, all that down the drain. “Nah, man, I need to be safe,” he said. “I need to get out of here alive so I can get back to doing this music and getting this money and find a lawyer to get you up out of here  quicker.”

“All right, bet.”

So we split up. He went to PC and they took me to population. The next morning RZA’s brother Divine came and bailed Dirty out.

Pop got bailed out. I got arraigned. I was in jail for eight months. I didn’t get no time off for good behavior because I was in there whoopin’ ass. I missed my first shot at a record deal going to jail. I could have got signed. But the whole time I was in there Dirty was making sure that my commissary was fat. He would go check on Pop. He would go see Patricia to make sure she had money and everything while I was in.

During that eight months Dirty was still working on his solo album and working with Wu-Tang. This was just before the Enter the Wu-Tang album dropped. They were about to blow up. Loud reissued “Protect Ya Neck” as their first single—this time with “Method Man” as the B-side—and on November 9, 1993, Loud released Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).

Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago

It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh

I'm really Saari, call me Arto

Eyes wide shut, barely eatin', tryna get my game on
Played it too cool, almost like I'm froze, had to turn my flame on
All the while, watch 'em X me out

Hoppin' in, out of shuttles, I'ma be big, momma, I'ma get rich, momma

Got a house that I barely can stay in, a car I barely can drive
I'd be a liar if I said gettin' money didn't make me feel alive
Hustlin', arguin' about who’s better than I in tweets
But what does it matter when a new artist come out like every week?
And the label all on they nutsack, good for them, keep suckin'
Most rappers'll bend over for you, but me? Bitch, I'm not for fuckin', over
I'd be the biggest star, they told me
Signed my name on that line and when I die, that's when it's over
Movin' on to the set, I was just a talented black kid
But to them, I looked like a check
Another five years of slavin' and then it's on to the next
I was tryna be what I envisioned as a child
A king ain't a man of God when ain't no church in the wild
Shit been fucked up 'cause they don't talk about Christ
Everybody trying to die young but who gon' talk about life?
I pull that card, good Lord, Confederate flag, shit so flawed
They used to fly it like pilots and burn crosses in our yards
I can't get with ya if you with that whistlin' Dixie they want that old time back
But niggas got a hundred rounds and automatics so we ain't having that
I ain't promotin' no violence, it's people out here been wildin'
So much that you can get gunned down just for being happy and smilin'
Ain't no hotline worth dialin' to say the world needs help
We too busy fillin' our needs that we might kill us ourselves
I got my gumption from my granny, had a dream about her like last night
She held me tight and told me, ""Little one, everything gon' be alright""
My mind playin' tricks on me, but I needed that there
In a world where I feel all alone sometimes I'm needin' her care
It's hard to share my insecurities so I medicate, I mean meditate
And pray to God for a second chance, for Heaven's sake
I'm just waitin' on a sign or two, like what I'ma do
When my heart get rusty and tired and it ain't shinin' through?
And I think about death a lot, my father scared of dyin'
I can relate, I call him before every flight, in case I ain't meant for flying
I can't hold it back, can't control these tears, I mean after all these years
I'm still the kid writin' poems, too shy to eat in the cafeteria
I'm two cups in and three shots away
From givin’ a fuck about any of the shit that I done had to say
Lord knows, it's hard to see the truth with your eyes closed
It's hard to protect your feelin's when you so exposed

Imagine if all the rappers were
To get with all the athletes or activists and actors for
A conference in Zaire to meet with all the ambassadors
In the motherland, tell 'em we comin' back for her
America know if we leave, it'd be a massacre
Zimbabwe would be full of drug dealers and traffickers
Smokin' brassica, pick all the hoes from Magic up
Tell Tabitha, let a nigga Cleopatra her
So we can build a neighborhood out in Zambia
Tell Khaled to build another one in Tanzania
What if Jay and Bey went and bought some land in Egypt?
And Puffy put a stripper club off the sands of Kenya?

Turn the Rwanda to a five star, with the spa
Chillin' in Angola with a skinny little Guinea broad
Somewhere in her 20s and she get my little Jimmy hard
'Cause her whole physique is unique
She petite, plus her daddy is the king of Mozambique
When I met him, he had on that new Patek Phillipe
Took a seat
Everything kosher like Jewish meat
My mystique got her intrigued in disbelief
And she speak 6 different languages including Greek
And I love the way her booty cheeks move to the beat
I'm Prince Akeem

We veterans so it's better if you go get your army
A thug holiday is where your body lay
Me and Trick Daddy come from a common place
So us gettin' money, that's just a conversation
It's so hard stayin' rich and miss the confrontations
Cigars in the Oval Office, Ronald Reagan
Hug Barack Obama, whisper, ""As-salāmu ʿalaykum""
Live for the moment, die for the streets
Bible on the dash, kilos on the seat
I used to see you niggas on my TV screen
And wondered what was life like, was it all a dream?
And then I met you out on LiveNation dates
Came to the realization that your watch was fake
Damn... you nearly broke my heart
I really thought you niggas really owned them cars

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
I used to look up to you, nigga
Ugh

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Hard to point a finger when you live a life of sin
I'ma bring my niggas with me if I lose or win
Bought a fleet of cars, let the bitches tag along
This little thing of ours, not the ones to tattle on
Omerta the code, Met Ball, parties with Vogue
Still blowin' thick smoke while you powder your nose
Such a head rush until the day the feds rush
That's when you niggas wish you put your bread up
Leased whips, bad blood, that shit'll sink ships
Fast money comin' slow, you better think quick
Rap game, so much fuck shit done
That's why this .45 in my Trukfit trunks
Fuck a skateboard, I went and got a Wraith, boy
Catholic record labels, niggas gettin' raped, boy
Birdman's a priest, moans in his synagogue
Publishin' is a sin, repent, forgive me, Lord
Shots fired, home invasion out on Palm Isle
Red beam detonators, who the bomb now?
Look you in your eyes, nigga, 'fore I say good night
And pray that Mannie Fresh'll get to see the light

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Damn, Stunna
I loved you, nigga
Hate it came to this
(Maybach Music)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
You stole them boys' pub' and bought a foreclosure
Scott Storch demons in it, which is more poison
I handed over records, never charged a coin
But could sense the sentiment, I'm talkin' all along
All Miami issues, Rozay handle for him
Same way Big Ducky do for me in California
Never slippin', got relationships with the trillest niggas
Tony Draper, J Prince and even Jimmy Henchmen
Plenty killers and I know that Diddy with it
Tyga, chinchilla, really ain't no penny pinchin'
Knew that you would never visit BG
Turk came home, take that boy a three piece
Shootin' dope, usin' coke, movin' like you the Folks
Sacrificin' half our life for your new music cult
You would give us self esteem and motivate our drive
But was in our pockets by the time we count to five
I pray you find the kindness in your heart for Wayne
His entire life, he gave you what there was to gain
I watched this whole debacle so I'm part to blame
Last request, can all producers please get paid?

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Can't believe this shit, homie
I still love you, nigga
How the fuck, nigga, you touch half a billion, nigga
And your team starvin', nigga?
You on an island, nigga, you came to my city, nigga
I let you in my city, nigga
And what hurt me the most, nigga
Is how you did my brother Khaled, nigga
Khaled was loyal to you, nigga
The pain I seen in my brother's eye, nigga
FaceTimin' my nigga, nigga, he took that to the chin, nigga
That's why my nigga blessed!
That's why my nigga Khaled blessed!
You put my nigga in the hole, homie
I don't feel you for that, my nigga
That shit hurt me, you under-dig? Umm
It's painful what you see real niggas do
When they get the paper, when they get the bag
You can't never forget 'bout lil bruh and them
I'll never forget 'bout lil bruh and them
Lil bruh and them, always remember
Lil bruh and them, this for lil bruh and them

I come here today to talk about how I feel
And I feel like that we are treated differently than other people
And I don't like how we’re treated
Just because of our color doesn't mean anything to me

[Pre-Chorus]
This just the way I feel
Mind's been racing so long, yeah
It’s just no way to deal
With these problems alone

[Chorus]
And I really can't take it no more
I've been fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm young and I'm restless

I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord, can you help me?

Now everybody got problems, yeah
But wouldn't know what way to solve ’em

Strugglin’, my momma on her last dollar
Hustlin' and I’ve been puttin' in these hours

It's really all about the money and the power
I just wanna see my people empowered
Uh, uh, tell me how we gon’ shape this vision
Complainin' all day, but in the same condition
If you wanna make change, it's gon' take commitment

Can't emancipate them from the mental prisons
What I seen through optics transform to wisdom
Watch me use my prophets, get 'em all to listen

Until they leave 'em lifeless

Lord knows we just tryna live righteous
Are you willin' just to make the sacrifices?
I know we can't continue livin' like this
And I'll never sell my soul 'cause that's priceless, uh, uh
Tell me how we gon' make a livin'
Hustle on the block, who gon' save the children?
Man it's all a plot and I'm just revealin'
The media just tryna make a villain
I just take the pain and a paint a picture
Voices in my head, I hear the whispers
When I feel this way, inhale the swisher
Or I sip the liquor, ah

Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

Keep it a 100
Uhh, yo

[Verse 1]
Somebody told me money rules the world, I know you heard that shit
Money the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit
I slaved away for ten hours a day at work and just finally got my check
But the ATM isn't working, shit
Oh, there it go (oh oh oh oh oh) damn, it's hot as hell
Punched in a pin code and grabbed a hundred dollar bill
I snatched it up and went back to my wheels
Hit up the plug and said ""I know you got some bud, I need that with some pills""
Meet me outside the gas station on Park Ave, I'll be waiting
Then put the cash in the glove compartment as I sat waiting
Damn, yo where's this nigga at?
Bout to light a cigarette while I-, oh, there he go
Opened up the glove compartment, told em to light this
Come around and drive inside and act normal like we ain't making a transaction
Take that (what up, what up?) I dapped him up and got to sliding
He crinkled it up, walked off then put it in his pocket
Off to the strip club with some drinks and some orders
He pull that hundred out his pocket, uncrinkled the corners
Stageside, watching this one bitch shaking and twirling
Busted it open all exotic and maybe she's foreign
She making eye contact, she got on eye contacts
She sees that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that
She's thinking ""I want that"", he takes a sip from his glass
She bend over, he slaps her ass and puts some ones in her crack
He whispered in her ear ""How long are you here? Tell me you single
Oh, you got a man? Fuck, I don't care, tell him I'm queer
Save my name as Susan in your contacts, hm
And fuck your relationship, I ain't worried about that, heheh
Can I use that red marker, sir?
Let me write my number on this hundred for you
Make sure you hit me up when your boyfriend can't do nothing for you
(508)-507-2209""
She got home and opened her purse as soon as she gets to the door
Counting them dollars, smoking tree while she sit on the floor
I don't think she like how this shit make her feel
But you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills
For real, she wanna get high now, uhh
Grab the Benjamin off the floor, she feeling alive now, uhh
Few grams of coke on the table, that's the right now, uhh
She rolled a hundred up and stuck it up her nose like
That's what she call Heaven's door
That's what she call Snow White, the white without seven dwarfs
She throw a hundred back at her purse and headed down to the store
She needed blunts for the gas, she needed gas for the Ford
She needed eggs and some dill, she needed cheese and some milk
She needed change

[Interlude]
""What what number is that?
I said what number is that on the bill, what is that?
Yes, in red, it's like a phone number
What is this? Never mind""

[Verse 2]
""Aye aye, don't you make one mothafucking move
Empty that register, I know you don't need my help
Hurry the fuck up, look, don't make me repeat myself
Gimme the cash, follow instructions, don't be fucking moving
Cause I'd hate to kill you over something stupid
Now hand me the bread and place your hands on top of your head
Take my tough advice
Turn around and count to a hundred if you love your life""

[Refrain]
Now keep it a 100
Uhh, keep it a 100
Yeah, keep it a 100
One hundred
Keep it a 100

[Verse 3]
Yo, somebody told me money rules the world, I know you heard that shit
Money's the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit
He put that hundred inside of collection plate on Sunday too
Hope that it'll take away your sins, maybe someday soon
But anyway, they covered the plate and just continued praying
After church, the pastor opened it up and started saying
""Lord forgive me but I need this, I've been really static""
And he grabbed the hundred off the top and started staring at it
Held it up to see if it's real or fake
Then looked around to make sure nobody was looking, and then he took it, damn
Off to the streets with the Lord, off to go find him a whore
A hundred bucks in the dash and now he riding the course
He see some bitch on the corner, he told her hop in the car
And then she opened the door
""Come on bitch, yo hurry the fuck up, I ain't tryna get caught up""
Then continued driving and stuff, looking for a spot in the cut
""How much for head?""
(A 100)
""Now how much for sex?""
(A 100)
""Damn, a 100?""
(Come on, that's not a lot)
""Fuck""
(Why you playing?)
""Nah, I'm just saying, that's a lot bitch, like gotta calm down, damn""
Now she making eye contact, she got on eye contacts
She see that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that
She's thinking ""I want that"", he pulls his dick out his pants
""Ooh God is good""
Transaction complete, and she went back to the streets
Back to the cash at the leash, she back to get back on her knees
And she don't like how this shit make her feel
But you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills
For real, she wanna retire soon, she swear to God (*smack*)
She looked up and seen the hand of God, oh my God...
Forgot she had a pimp
That nigga been looking for her ass for days
Took every single dollar and left her eye black and gray
He be on the corner jamming, getting drunk that-a-way
7-Eleven gambling, throwing all his cash away, yup
Some say that money rule the world, I know you heard that shit
Money the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit
Yeah, that pimp just lost that hundred dollars in that dice game
He said ""I should've just bet that shit on tonight's game, whatever nigga, nice game""
The homie who won it walked off with the hundred
Then opened up his wallet, stuck it inside and then put it in his pocket
Started stomping and running
Feeling so good, started hopping and jumping, money flopping and rumbling
His eyes is as big as his smile, no stopping him from the prow
He's jogging, skipping around, 'til his wallet fell on the ground
A hundred sticking halfway out, in the back of a halfway house
For like three weeks so don't even ask me how, check it
A homeless man walks by, sees a wallet, opens his eyes
And then grabs it, opens to check what's inside and to his surprise
It's money, a couple dollars, a hundred bill with some writing
A number written in red, if he had a phone he would call
But he doesn't, so he says ""Fuck it, it's mine
And I'm really hungry and thirsty, I want some beer, a beef jerky
Maybe some ten percent juice, hm
And if the store's open, I need some cigarettes too"", true
He walked into the same store on the block
Just so happen to be the same exact store that got robbed
What a coincidence, that shit is just as weird as I thought
The clerk rang him out and said, ""That'll be 18.25""
And then he held that hundred out with the red number written on top
Then everything stopped

With all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', ""Black Lives Matter""
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', ""Nigga,"" this, and, ""Nigga,"" that
Call everybody, ""Nigga,"" and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, ""Nigga,"" then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
""They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom""
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear

[Verse 2]
With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, ""All Lives Matter,"" is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, ""Nigga,"" is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
