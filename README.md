### #1: LVMH Brands and Rappers

Using Spotify streaming data and the Rap Genius API, we can see what LVMH brands are being mentioned in the top streamed rap songs of the last 4 years.

We take a deep dive into Louis-Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH): the luxury powerhouse led by Bernard Arnault, the 4th richest person in the world. From Pop Smoke’s ‘Dior’ to ‘Hennything is possible’, LVMH’s brands have become the norm in rap and the culture in recent years. We take look at how rappers have used Bernard’s empire as a conduit of rap braggadocio, and how that has grown in the last several years. Ultimately, our thesis is to try and establish a connection between the growth of these lyrics in the rap zeitgeist and LVMH’s bottom line. We broke down the Spotify streaming numbers and lyrics of the most popular rap songs in the last 5 years. How many times have you heard these brands in your favorite songs? 


The attached Python notebook walks through how we gathered the Spotify streaming data along with the Genius API data in order to get the lyrics from these rap songs and tie them back to LVMH brands.
