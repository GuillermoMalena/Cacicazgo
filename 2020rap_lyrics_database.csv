Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day
Bunch of hollows spittin' out the Glock
I been servin' fiends all day, out there posted with the gang
Nigga, we was taught to get it off the block
It's a hundred bands in the safe, now I got expensive taste
Mike Amiri jeans, fill 'em up with knots
I been on my grind every day, don't believe in takin' breaks
I ain't stoppin' 'til we chillin' at the top

[Verse 1]
Swervin' on the E-way, don't care if I crash in this coupe
Shit I'm thinkin' 'bout too real, might lose my mind in this coupe
Can't relapse off these drugs, man, R.I.P. to Juice
We was tweakin' off them Percs, I popped my last one with you
Bond tight with my day ones, ain't tryna find no recruits
We was playin' give and take on that front line with my troops
Ayy, like who want smoke? We got plenty guns
Keep two lil' savages on X and they gon' get it done
And them hollow tips do surgery, they gon' clip his lungs
It was goin' down on the set, that's when this shit was fun
I just been ballin' on these niggas like I'm Kendrick Nunn
Every day my birthday, bitch, it's lit, I just turned twenty-one

Ever since I stepped up in this game, I've been a bomb threat
I was in the trenches, tryna see a life beyond that
'Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex
Nigga, where I'm from, they turn death into a contest
Livin' by the gun, put all my trust into this compact
My niggas went to war, but they ain't get no Vietnam check
Lil' bro want his head, he tryna make his brains ooze
Lil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues
I been a real nigga 'fore this shit became cool
I'm the type to switch my watch up every time I change moods
He the type to get excited 'cause he made The Shade Room

Decorate your block with red tape, foenem slidin' every day

Girl, I can't wait 'til I get home to fuck the shit out of you
Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
They be Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend

I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me
I know sometime I'm crazy, I was hopin' you could bear with me
Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

[Verse 1]
Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

[Verse 3]
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

[Chorus]
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight

Well respected in this hip-hop, lil' Polo be spittin' facts
A lot of rappers doin' way more stuntin' than givin' back
You ain't my color, then you don’t know the struggle of livin' black
Cops kill us and we protest, what type of shit is that?
Man, if the police shoot at one of my brothers, I'm blickin' back
We hate each other, so we just wanna score and go tit-for-tat
All these shorties want is points, they ain't chasin' a different stat
Really riskin' it all, what’s the point when that nigga rat?
We seventeen, got forty years in that court when we gettin' cracked
Stuck in the system, they just watchin' us fail while they sittin' back
The government cuttin' checks, but can't cut a nigga some slack
It's hard to get a job, so we hustle and flip a pack
It's all a set-up, no wonder why they call this bitch a trap
Life was messed up, a matter of time 'til that nigga snap
Post-traumatic stress, so them triggers keep gettin' tapped
R.I.P. Malcolm, I promise to conquer and fill them gaps
Them corners leave a nigga boxed in, tryna break free
Crazy how I love the same block that tried to break me
Pray that I ain't in my own hood when they take me
This all we know, a life of peace what we can't see
I'm from where we unheard and we can't speak
We go to school, they try to tell us what we can't be
Profit with a billion-dollar mind like I'm JAY-Z
They killed Martin for dreamin' and now I can't sleep
Why would the devil take my brother if he close to me?
Now if you stare into my soul, you'll see my bros in me
We missin' you, man, this ain't how this shit supposed to be
Feel like I'm stuck, I wish them streets never proposed to me
Out there posted in the field with them soldiers deep
So now the other side wanna put a hole in me
Like every day might be the end of the road for me
We die young, so I couldn't picture a older me
Fightin' demons, let them drugs take control of me
All in my head, go and kill what they told to me
'Member we ain't have a thing, same clothes for weeks
Hardbody, that's how them situations molded me
Needed money and grew accustomed to this fast life
Pressure from this way of livin', so we blast pipes
Shit got me stressin' three hundred and sixty-five nights
Them people workin' against us like we don't have rights
It don't matter what this money and this fame can give
I've been hurtin', tryna smile through the pain and tears
Wish we could go back to them days when we played as kids

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy

Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah

I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""

But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

Picked up a brick, he merched it on Brick and threw it at my whip

Now, Von, think quick, what you finna do? 'Cause this gon' make the news
Gotta make your move, told that bitch, ""Get in,"" 'cause she lookin' confused
I broke the rules, 'cause this bitch a witness, plus I just popped dude
But she ain't cryin', plus this ho was smilin' and this bitch looked cute
So we slide out, I'm checkin' my mirrors, made it to the house
Told her hop out, she say that she hungry, I nod back, ""No doubt""
""I know you mad 'cause I smoked your man, left him on the curb""

You broke my heart and made it into million pieces
Man I can't deal with you no more
Get the fuckin' out my life now
Cause I can't deal with you no more, no more

Now you turned into my enemy, here we go again
I think love is just like money how it blows in the wind
Got me taking medicine, these is not no vitamins

I feel like the greatest
Only been at this for two years, thank God this shit happened so quick
Fashion me the latest, money comin' in but so do hatred
Shit ain't how I pictured, but I faced it
Emotions, I erased it, fuck havin' feelings, I replaced it
Should've peeped that fu' shit from the basis
This when the mistakes hit, tired of gettin' caught up in this fake shit
I just can't sit comfy with no snake shit

[Refrain]
I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie
So if you ain't ready to die, then don't try
I gotta make it home so my mama don't cry
I'd rather do the sentence, least time'll go by
Feel the pain, so numb, I don't feel nothin'
Shooters still runnin' 'round with no chill button
Still be totin' in the town, finna drill somethin'
Let a nigga run up on me thinkin' I won't kill somethin'

And I keep the gang with me, try it, bet we air shit
Everybody get it, if it's static, we don't spare shit
Really on my bully, 2020, we ain't playin'
Now it's lit for everything, don't care 'bout what you sayin'
Mama, she was prayin', I was on that block late
Really put in twenty years of work, but then I got weight
Sunday I ain't never go to church because that block pay
Big .40 cal' in my shirt, no karate
Fuck what the opps say, fuck what the cops say
Big Smelly drive, E for E, that's the block way
If you feel a way, grrt-baow what the Glock say
All my niggas tryna get the bag, fuck the pop way

I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years

Words that they did not say, dick suckin' crazy
Everybody tryna beach for clout like it's wavy
Guess I'm just too real, I stood solid, how they made me
I can never be a goofy nigga if they paid me
Songs too heat now, everything is wavy
Lot of niggas think it's competition, they amaze me
I was goin' downhill, jail kinda saved me
Gotta keep the hard work, ain't no gettin' lazy
Smokin' opposition kinda sorta got me dazy
Think you'd last a day up in my shoes, then nigga, trade me
Bitch, I need a billion in blues like I'm JAY-Z
Huh, R.I.P. to Mavy
Bitch, I'm cookin' now, got the sauce like it's gravy
If you want a feature, get your money right and pay me
Still, when the time come, it might be a maybe
It depend on the type of record that you gon' play me
I can't do a wack verse, industry would trade me
Every time you hear my name, you know I'm goin' crazy
Really, I'm a trench kid, SB really made me
Really had the same goal and dream since a baby, ooh-ooh-ooh
