I was blowin' on the dank with my niggas
I was lookin' for the girls who willin'

If you smokin' with me, then we on dabs

Come and do that little thing that you was doin'
Ayy, they was in this mothafucka trippin'

It seems like we fuckin' in this club
Baby girl, what they think that we're doin'?
You gettin' on my nerves with them questions
Girl, you know I'm tryna start a little movement
I ain't got no business fuckin' with you
Out the blue, you actin' brand new
Washingtons mean nothing to you

[Hook] x2
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

[First Verse]
I’m feeling so offbeat
Every step expecting to drop
Knees down to the floor
And the ground couldn’t stop these thoughts
If I fell face flat/ can’t fail/ hate that
I’m back up on my feet that’s not me
Run back to my comfort zone but I refuse to quit
‘Cause I’m cool with this
Take all my flaws/ make music with
I don’t know how these standard emcees
Are reaching a point where they’re setting these standards
Oh well/ hands off their coattails
Eyes on your prize/ don’t gloat when your foes fail
‘Cause it’s not about them
It’s all about you
Don’t jump all smug at the front
And emerge as a prick
Keep going/ ignore what they say
Then do it like Jay and just fuck up the world like…

[Hook] x2
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

[Second Verse]
Feel like I’m overly critical
Show it through poems and flow like I’m lyrical
Fact is I map this anger out to a banger
And attack anyone who’s coming my way
Like I’m doing right now
Everything I write down
Know it’s so typical
Stone cold cynical
Hope so miniscule
Feel so lost but I feel so invincible
Feel I can do it my way
Thinking every minute
“KD, why wait?”
Know I’ve got a talent but I’m still unsure
But that’s life in a cold world
Just love yours; I tell myself
But still fail to accept any help
I feel like I’m doing it wrong
The newer the song
The better I feel
But never reveal
How I feel when I see they’re all moving along

[Hook]
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

[Third Verse]
Fuck this
Frustrated, everything is too much
And I erupt in a rage/ can’t function
Doused in a ‘bout of confusion and numbness
Why do I care what the fuck you want?
I’m doing my thing so fuck you mugs
Can’t dumb down when the gloves come off
I don’t care, either way, you’re getting punched up bruv
Emcees throw a dismal punch
Can’t spit/ no pistol when fists go up
So they talk slick/ tweet with their lips all shut
Hidden when the villains let their pitbulls run
Sniffing out their minimal ability
And kill ‘em within minutes of revealing where they stay
Finish them/ it’s vicious/ unh
Spit all I envision in my inner chamber
Door’s locked/ no entry
I enter only when I vent I know me
I need that fuel and I ignore the danger
I go to God when I feel deranged
And I feel that anger and I can’t contain it
I slowly feel I might go insane
‘Cause I’m running in circles inside my brain
It’s just madness/ climaxing
A hyperactive overload of life and passion so

[Hook]
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world

Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch, I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016
And I'm screamin' fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listened to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one
Savage, I ain't even hatin'""
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
""Savage, I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch, I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on, man, Savage, you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

They say crack kills, nigga, my crack sells

Niggas get lucky, standin' right there by the rainbow (leprechaun)
No rain though, I'm in the Yung Rich Nation raincoat (rain)
Good aim though, that red dot up at your Kangol (b-b-baow)
Lookin' in my DM and I see your main ho (ayy)
You know we the ones that came up with the bando (you know)
Them boys talkin' 'bout the boards on the windows (bando)
When you trappin', keep a shooter at the front door
Fuck, twelve! Runnin' out the back do' (ayy)
The ring on my pinky is bigger than a globe (woo!)
Skippa Da Flippa done flipped a nigga, never fold (Flippa)
Pipin' up in front of your bitch, you'll get elbowed (baow)
Ping pong, hit a nigga with the ring on (ayy)
Yung Rich Nation jeans on, it's yo' theme song (huh)
So many pints in my crib, it's a lean home (lean)
I'm so high, I just need a wall to lean on
Phone home, get so stoned when we gone (stoned)
Cookie smokin', the ozone, rich snow cone (ice)
Mink, it cost five, I leave the coat on (mink)
Big Tymer, get your roll on (Rollie)
Clap a nigga with the Ric Flair robe on, hold on (hold on)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando (graat)
We the first ones that came up with the bando (bando)
Talking ‘bout you got the Act but what they goin’ for (Act')
I’m bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow (ayy)
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors (boom)
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold ('sace)
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for (bitch)
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you, thinkin’ ‘bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister
That chopper hit you, having a seizure (ayy)
I been teaching niggas lingo like I’m a teacher
Mamacita, she looking like a picture of Mona Lisa
Fucked ‘em up with the dab, so we goin’ up on the feature
All of my bitches they piped up and conceited

[Verse 2: Offset]
Offset!
Semi-automatic out the window of the Caddy (graow)
I know this shit is tragic, toss your bitch up like a salad (smash)
Walk up in the mansion, I just made a money pallet (mansion)
Trappin’ out the bando, selling crack up in the alley (crack)
I send my young niggas, act a fool with the tool (baow)
Contemplating, should I drop a four or drop a deuce?
Heard you a real slick looking for a good lick (lick)
But my niggas ain’t going for the bullshit (naw)
I got the stick, nigga don’t trip (pow)
Nigga run up in your house and tying up your bitch (graat)
Boot up that bitch in the morning on grits (boot)
J’s at the bando in the morning, got to fix (J's)
I’m sitting on the pedestal, my diamonds look impeccable (shine)
Your bitch sucking my dick just like an edible (ugh)
Make her take a physical like medical (physical)
Fucking bitches overseas like it’s America (ayy)
You niggas don’t even know I got some pain in me (pain in me)
Missing my grandma, wish she could sing to me (grandma)
A lot of dirt I did, I got some shame in me (argh)
When I’m pulling up I drop the brain on it (skrr)
Came in the game with the fashion statement (ha)
We dropped Versace, the fame it came quick ('sace)
Got to stay focused, consistent, don’t quit (ayy)
Brick on my wrist and it make me a lick (dab)

[Chorus: Takeoff]
All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando (graat)

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Quavo
The way they took a nigga’s dab I want to smack a nigga (baow)
Knock a nigga’s lights out, Uncle Wack a nigga (Wack 100)
These niggas made out of plastic like a action figure (plastic)
I can’t kick it with your bitch, I ain’t no Falcon’s kicker (naw)
Young nigga in the hood eating Honey-sicles (ugh)
I’ma send your ho a text with the purple pickle (ho)
Nigga I ain’t gotta flex, I’m a real nigga (naw)
I know niggas in the bando still trapping nickles (uhh)
Pop a perc, you think I’m Marshawn eating Skittles (perky)
Everybody still comparing Migos to the Beatles (everybody)
Who the fuck you think you scaring with that lil nina? (who)
Call my niggas and they pulling up like 'Al-Qeeda' (ayy)
Damn I mean Al-Qaeda, spray ‘em like a firefighter
For fucking with the albino, feeling like Mekhi Phifer
Niggas having ghostwriters, stripes like I’m Tony Tiger
Migo gang the three igniters, then they try to doubt us (ayy)
I know you remember the titans (titans)
You know we got that touch like we work for Midas (Midas)
Like my cookie with the purple in it like the Vikings
Came from a long road, you the one that starts hitchhiking (that's you)
I pour a glass of water ‘cause you wanna pop a Vicodin (water)
I open up the door, she said damn my mans you’re frightening (woah)
Spikes on my shoe, yeah I’m Christian Loub, Mike-ing it (spikes)

I gave a bitch a Plan B (Open your mouth)
‘Cause she was my plan B (Side bitch)
I got my hoe on a leash (Get over here)
She a real trapper in the streets
My niggas don’t mean no harm, unless you come handling me (My niggas don’t mean it)
Cookie bag and a Percocet, that’s what applied to me (I’m geeking)
The dab is not a sneeze (Dab)
I fuck her once, then she leave (Smash)
She only got her fucking keys; I give her phone down the street

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Eat it up - busy bees
Stevie Wonder, play with keys
I told my plug, “Yadda mean,”
That mean, “Come on, with them things,”
I put the work ‘cross seas
Feel like I play with Kareem
I walk around with the nin’
Hundred thousand for the team
I woke up ‘cause I had a dream
I shot at nigga in the spleen
Two niggas looking like Kel and Ken’
Your favorite cousin, dope fiends
I was going on a mission
But I swapped out my hoe for that
Young nigga talking business
Tell that nigga I ain’t here for that
Migo Gang like the Thundercats
And I’m trapping out a Hellcat
Pussy nigga, you a lab rat
Bitch, my diamonds doing jumping jacks
Pull up, gave a Phantom heart attack
Hoe nigga, where your heart is at?
We quick to send ‘em to the cardiac
Cookies and Perc’ – that’s the starter pack
Go to the jeweler; want all of that
Ball on my court, nigga, can’t get the ball back
I be where the money fall at
I take the pot and beat it with a ball bat
You ain’t own it boy, you rented that
If it ain’t broke I ain’t fixing that
I put the dope in the trunk
I put the extras in the kitty-cat

[Chorus: Quavo]
I gave a bitch a Plan B (Open your mouth)
‘Cause she was my plan B (Side bitch)
I got my hoe on a leash (Get over here)
She a real trapper in the streets
My niggas don’t mean no harm, unless you come handling me (My niggas don’t mean it)
Cookie bag and a Percocet, that’s what applied to me (I’m geeking)
The dab is not a sneeze (Dab)
I fuck her once, then she leave (Smash)
She only got her fucking keys; I give her phone down the street

[Verse 2: Offset]
Fuck on me, then fuck my brother
Just because she’s your bitch, you don’t trust her
These bitches really trying to come up
Damn, she trapped you, you nutted up
When you went to work, I had picked her up
She said she want to kick it on the bus
Fucking and sucking up all of us
You know how we do; we just slaughtered her
My jeweler made me look like Slick the Ruler
My bitches bougie, walking with a poodle
When I was little, thought bitches had cooties
Now that I’m grown, got a brick in her coochie
Finesse the plug; I hit him with the whoop-de-whoo
Finessed him right out his shoe
I got some boot in my Margiela boots
Bitches running ‘round my mansion in nude
Bitches stick to me like Gorilla Glue
Smoking on cookies did somebody poo?
You niggas is suckers; you a roody-poo
YRN 2, ball alert, got the news
Sipping on Actavis, like it’s a brew
(Aye, Boaw!) Who shot at you?
Yes we can fuck, is your friend fucking too?
(Ooh, Boaw!) I’m killing her too
Plan B, you can fuck her for free
Make sure that shit don’t get back to wifey
Skeet on her cheek, fuck her one time a week
Get a Plan B, ‘cause I know I was geeked
Fucking this bitch, went to sleep
I got to get this bitch a Plan B
She fucking that nigga, that nigga, then me
I just want that mouth, ‘cause I know it’s on fleek!

[Chorus: Quavo]
I gave a bitch a Plan B (Open your mouth)
‘Cause she was my plan B (Side bitch)
I got my hoe on a leash (Get over here)
She a real trapper in the streets
My niggas don’t mean no harm, unless you come handling me (My niggas don’t mean it)
